First project on the Odin Project curriculum. The goal was to make a recipes website.

To do so I have used the basic HTML knowledge I have learned whilst trying to commit
 often to explain how have I been doing so. 

On the index.html file you can find  a very welcoming and creative heading describing the content and nature of the webpage.

Below you can find listed three links which will take you to three different webpages containing three different recipes.

Each page presents you with a different recipe with its ingredients and the steps to follow on the quest to recovering your HP during this adventure called life.

In this project I tried to showcase my understanding of HTML elements such as paragraphs, lists, links and images.

After learning about CSS, styling and the cascade I have come back to improve my website appearance. I did this through external CSS linking and making use
of ID, class and type selectors.
